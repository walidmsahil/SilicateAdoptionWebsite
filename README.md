### Feature 1

We made the basket button that takes you to the shopping cart and payment page, we designed the payment page. The products as well as customers will be added to the database.

### Feature 2 

We created login/sign in page for customers, once they sign in they'll be added to the systems database. The login page is not functional for now but users can sign up to add their data to the user table.

### Feature 3

We created the adopt out page which allows customers to give up their cat for adoption. Once they fill up the form the cat will be added to the database.

### Feature 4

We created the contact form, which allows the customers to ask questions/give feedback or suggestions to the company. The customer info as well as the information they provided will be added to the database.

### Feature 5

We created adoption form for adopting your dream cat. Once the customer fills up the form, the cat will be moved to "Adopted" table in the database from the "Available cats" table. 

### Feature 6  

We made sliding banners on the home page to change every specified number of seconds, providing diverse information for our customers and creating a unique design for our page.

### Feature 7

We made the random cat button generate a perfect cat for a customer.

### Feature 8

We made a slide out menu in our header. The concept is to make it look more mobile user-friendly.

### Feature 9

We added JS a validation for all of our forms, so the user can fill them up in the correct way.
